# Navigating Threats in Federated Recommender Systems: A Survey of Poisoning Attacks and Defense Strategies
This repository complements our survey by providing curated codebases, datasets, and tools related to poisoning attacks and defense strategies in Federated Recommender Systems (FedRS). It aims to support reproducibility, benchmarking, and practical experimentation for researchers and developers working in this emerging domain. In addition to summarizing academic efforts, we provide hands-on resources to help the community reproduce existing works, test new hypotheses, and accelerate deployment in both research prototypes and real-world production environments. This bridge between theory and implementation is critical for driving innovation in secure federated recommendation systems.

## Reproducibility Aspects (Evaluation Frameworks and Data Sets):
We have carefully selected widely-used, publicly available datasets and evaluation frameworks that are commonly adopted in federated recommender systems research. These resources include real-world user-item interaction datasets, federated data partitioning schemes, and benchmark metrics to ensure fair and consistent comparison across different attack and defense models. The goal is to enable reproducibility of experimental results and support standardized evaluation for future studies in this domain.

## Attack models 

This section collects and curates recent implementations of poisoning attack models specifically adapted or designed for federated recommender systems. Federated learning introduces unique vulnerabilities due to decentralized training, which attackers exploit through gradient manipulation, malicious client behaviors, or data poisoning. We selected state-of-the-art and representative attack modelsâincluding both classical and AI-driven methodsâto facilitate understanding, benchmarking, and extension by researchers and practitioners.

## Defense models 
This section compiles key defense mechanisms tailored to mitigate poisoning attacks in federated recommender systems. Given the collaborative yet vulnerable nature of FL-based RS, defense strategies must address adversarial behaviors while preserving model utility and personalization. We include recent implementations of robust aggregation techniques, anomaly detection methods, and adaptive learning strategies that have shown effectiveness in FL settings. These resources support the community in replicating, comparing, and extending defense techniques in realistic scenarios.
